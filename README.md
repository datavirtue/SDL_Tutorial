This is an adapted repo of the SDL tutorials at lazyfoo.net.  Starting with the organization and structure of the code from sdltutorials.com I try to add each bit of functionality as new or revised methods of a basic game loop and event/rendering class.  The goal is to use this repo as a tool for learning 2D game code structuring and the SDL library for rendering graphics and handling events.
