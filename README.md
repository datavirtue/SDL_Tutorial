This is an adapted version of the SDL 1.2 tutorial from sdltutorials.com.  One quickly runs into issues when following this tutorial and learns that it is based on an old release of SDL. The olde version of SDL (quite old) is 1.2, the new version is 2.0 (quite modern).  This repo will develop as I progress through the tutorials found at http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php.  These seem to pick up where Tim Jones of sdltutorials.com left off and thier existence is probably why he has not updated his.  

SDL is a a C++ library that eases one into OpenGL game development.  This repo is developed as a Code::Blocks project on Windows 10 using MingW.
